# Journal-Project
A simple program to take screenshots of my laptop activity during the day and allow me to review my activity 


# ScreenGrab.py

Creates a folder and keeps taking screenshots on the minute. Use -t or --time to change this value to increase the interval between screen shots.

# faceScreen.py

Takes a webcam picture along with a screenshot and appends the two images and saves them, if you want to keep track of wether your computer was just switched on while you weren't really doing work at your system.

# guiInterface
Still being developed to allow the code to run seamlessly in the background
